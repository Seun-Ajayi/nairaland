Let's face it really, it's a man's world. Yes, women are helping out in the finances of the house now more than ever, but that by no means diminishes the man’s authority.In an ideal marriage however, the husband does not laud his authority over the wife. If there is mutual respect, I should think both parties are well aware of their duties and carry them out as at when due. What women are to men are helpers. If men are without us they become almost clueless. We both (the two sexes) cannot do without the other. As the head of the house, the man is enamoured with huge responsibilities such as security for his family,  financial provision and he is also the voice of wisdom most of the time. Nothing diminishes a man's respect faster than constantly shacking his responsibilities as the head of the family. If the head of the house remains faithful to these duties, there is absolutely no question of the wife's and indeed the children's respect for him.

This explains the reason why some women will date a married man, especially if she doesn't mind becoming a second, third or fourth wife, as the case may be.But as for the man, he knows what he is looking for. If he has a wife at home and is dating other women outside, then that is wrong. It should not be encouraged. If he is separated or divorced and dating other women, maybe he wants to marry another wife. It doesn't matter whether he is a christian or muslim, he may not have the grace to remain like that.It is also possible for a married man to date women, not for the purpose of sex, but just for friendship or companionship. Maybe he is having problem in his home, or the wife have been sicked for a long time, etc. He just wants the friendship of a woman, somebody who understands.So, it is better to examine each situation and circumstances separately before raising condemnation or commendation.

       "   {'text': 'Before we keep going on and on about how brave papermoon is for posting her story here, let\\'s not forget what\\'s really happened. A wife lost her marriage of how many years and had a breakdown, a family lost their son, twin boys lost their father and while all of these events cannot be directly attributed to you, Papermoon, you were part of a chain of events that led to this situation. You are talking about writing a book to profit from this situation, well, that is the American way, isn\\'t it. My problem with this story is not that it happened, because the truth is, I am not condemning you, because we are all human and even the best of us are seduced into making foolish and selfish decisions. However my problem with this story is that it tends to glamorize the situation. We went here and there, I was spending 3000 on bags etc, if indeed you want to stop other women from making the same decision, then maybe you should talk more about how you felt in those midnight hours, when you might have been lonely or ashamed or talk more about when you went to that dark place of potential suicide etc. The reason why I say this, is that there are some girls that will read this and in spite of every thing you have said still be so thick as to say, well you own betta, at least you still have the money etc. They will not be able to see past the bling into the true tragedy of the situation. I mean consider this that Massimo may have been the one meant for you and he was on his way to you, but unfortunately through a cruel twist of fate, you met his in-law first. Consider the situation carefully, note each point at which you could have walked away and didn\\'t.Furthermore what really struck me, was the arrogance displayed towards the wife. It is funny how a man choosing a woman to sleep with a woman on the side over his wife that he ultimately gives his name and totally aligns with in all ways that matter, gives women a false sense of bravado. At a moment when you should have been filled with shame, you were so full of false pride. \"It\\'s not my fault, you man wants me, \"Before you launch into me, note that I am not judging you, because I have been down a similar road myself when I was single. Fortunately I was able to find my inner self and pull out before things got out of control, and so I know first hand how a good girl can get herself in a bad situation, but when I look back at my own s**t, I honestly note where and how I made bad decisions. Now many years later, I have found out that Karma is one bad bitch!Papermoon, I wish you well. You have been in the thick of it and unfortunately have lasting repercussions. His family\\'s attitude towards you while painful is totally understandable. The best you can do, is seek some sort of peace for yourself, forgive yourself and tell the story as honestly and as openly as you can. Although consider your boys before you publish your book, it\\'s their story too.',\n",

If he had gotten rid of his wife there would be no regret would there? Bottom line you where picked up, seen for the cheap tart that you are, bought and dumped. oh he must have respected you, you said he wanted you to engage in threesomes, and the rest hmmm, yeah he respected you alright.

Are you even educated or did you spend the better part of your early teens , twenties with a sign on your head saying''i am a cheap Nigerian LovePeddler buy me clothes, bags,trips and i am yours''I think the real story is probably one of the Nigerian girls you hear going to Italy to sell themselves cheaply.You say i am hating, yeah you right, i am hating the fact that you got two kids from being a prostitute on the sly and now your well has run dry, tell you what, i would rather starve, be homeless than have the life which you now so regret, admit it, you hate it.I was actually going to ask if you are seeing a psychologist yourself. If not do. there is nothing shameful about it dear. Hey! how does it feel to be 29 and a has been? i just hope to God you have a job as i would hate to think i pay to feed your children (if that is true). You are a home wrecking cheap tart, no respect for yourself, disgrace to your family i'm sure, selfish and completely self absorbed. You did not think of what you were doing to this man's family, yeah it takes two but you had a choice and you took the road of self destruction and you totally deserve any pain you have now , infact i think you got off lightly. If you were from a loaded family why go sponging off someone else? where was your ambition? oh! i forgot women like you only aim so far,Cheap cheap cheap tart, and you were definitely the dumb one, like i would want to listen to what a self confessed ''high class prostitute has to say''\\xa0 Do me a favour crawl back underneath the rock you came from and go look after your kids, don't come here playing the matyre.  Nah! its of no interest to the british public and if he was like she said a multi milionaire from italy, it would make sense that if all the major papers like she said were interested in the story, they would go ahead and publish and\\xa0 make more money. £20,000 was not exactly overwhelming 9yrs ago, £20grand could not buy a house 9yrs ago in London, so she is full of doodoo.

I couldn't help marvelling at Al Pacino's and Rob Deniro's combined acting talents all over again. Another one is 'The Shawshank Redemption' - amazing film. Usual suspect- absolutely amazing. 'Murder In The First' -- about Alcatraz and the hideous things that went on in those cells before it was finally shut down. I love 'Pretty Woman' as well on the lighter side. Ah well, I could go on forever about the films I love but I best give you guys a chance to do the same. So, who likes any of these films as much as I do?Ciao.\",\n",

       "   {'text': \"Talking about movies again, I heard someone utter a statement barely an hour ago that reminded me of a film I saw ages ago and loved so much. I can't remember just how many times I saw the movie in question but let's just say that I can still say so many lines from it offhand. I'm talking about the all time comedy 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil'. Now that was some funny film. For the benefit of those who never saw this film, please go to your nearest video club on Friday night, curl up on the sofa and have a wild time laughing all the way preferably with your husband, wife, partner, b/gfriend as the case may be. Two friends; one blind, one deaf dominated the film to the end; hence, it's all telling title.Moving on to heavier stuff, some might start thinking I'm obsessed if I say I saw Hotel Rwanda again last weekend , well I did.Let me tell you a bit about the film, enough to whet your appetite. For starters, it's a true life story about the genocide in Rwanda. The film is so perfect that you actually momentarily forget you are not in Rwanda. The emotion that wracks through you to the very end reassures you that there is hope left for humanity yet. It is the story of a man who single-handedly saved the lives of so many people. Well, maybe I shouldn't say single-handedly because some of his hotel staff helped him out.The man was none other than Don Cheadle (starred in Ocean 11 &12, Sword Fish amongst other films). What never fails to amaze me is how this American mastered the Rwandan accent so perfectly. Well, I must add that he spent a long time in Rwanda prior to the shooting and met with the man whose life he sought to portray (Paul Rusesabagina) who is still very much alive.In another part of this forum we were discussing what makes a man the head of his family and how respect is earned by him. If and when you see this film, you will marvel at the faith and complete trust the wife (acted by our own Sophie Okonedo, a Nigerian, an Ibo girl, though she was born and weaned in the UK) had in her husband. The husband is Hutu (the ruling tribe) while the wife is Tutsi (the minority massacred in Rwanda). It was like the case of the uproars between Ishekiris and Ijaws in Warri. You know Ijaws married to Itshekiris and vice versa were killed during the crisis, some even by their very husbands. But this guy stood up to provide a refuge for his wife's people together with others who were merely neighbours and those who ran to him for help.He disregarded his own life and submitted himself to fate. He even managed a sense of humour through it all. The only reason Ray Charles got the OSCAR and Hotel Rwanda didn’t is simply because it is still very fresh in victims’ memories and might lead to a crisis in America between whites and blacks based on the way the whites in Rwanda treated the indigenes when they were in dire trouble and needing their help. And of cause, forgive this escaping my memory; the whites started the whole problem in the first place by empowering the Hutus and then leaving the Tutsi’s in government. The best thing, really, is to see this movie. It is now available on DVD and I'm sure you can obtain a copy if you go to any major film shop or something. If you see it and it's anything less than I've proclaimed, please feel free to have a go at me... only don't swear please!\",\n",

And yet, here we are at the starting blocks all over again...First of all, I would like to say that I find the use of the word DOMESTICATING very degrading and denigrating... Men are not animals.. and we shouldnt be addressed as such.. if it had been women which had been the subject of a post of this nature, we would have been hearing fire and brime-stone about our \"sexist\" comments and statements...Secondly, the fact that some men choose not to indulge in house chores doesn\\'t make it a generality.. It would be instructive and enlightening for the men in the house who do not subscribe to doing the house chores to come forth and declare in their respective house holds what the current women population is.. how many females they are currently living with or were living with at the time they chose not to do the house chores.. [I\\'m sure these men aren\\'t bachelors.. or even if they are, possibly have female younger ones living with them..]As for me, I have neither had problems with keeping my house clean or with doing my own cooking.. My house is my palace, and I treat it as such.. I do not have to wait for a woman to come to my house to keep it in the state I\\'m acustomed to.. In approaching a topic like this, one should add a reasonable degree of balance.. In the traditional african society of way back, the \"traditional\" role of the man was as bread winner, and of the woman was as \"home maker\"... This was the norm then, and was the way children were brought up to respect and emulate.. the fact that modern society has evolved to the point where women now have more active roles in the family, does not make the traditions to now become irrelevant.. or that they should be done away with.. That having been said.. very few children get raised without some form of home training.. depending on one\\'s circumstances in life, that would range from the basics of personal hygiene and home making to more complex tasks as cooking.. I\\'m very certaint that no Nigerian child was raised without the knowledge of the basics in the kitchen.. [otherwise they\\'d starve.. ].. and even the one who didnt have the opportunity to hone these skills at home would have done so at their various tertiary institutions.. [even if it meant using a ring boiler to make tea for breakfast or eba... ]These skills don\\'t just die away.. they are latent.. Hence every man has a certaint facility around the house.. whether they choose to display this is their own choice.. but most certaintly, men are not animals to be \"domesticated\"...My two kobo...

In Nigeria, most men can get away with not being \"domesticated\" [I still hate the word.. ] becuase the cheaper state of the nation (compared with overseas) can permit the use of house-helps and the likes, to take care of that aspect of home care.. Overseas, life is more expensive.. hence, in order to maintain the same level of home care at optimal budget, chores have to be shared between partners.. (to a certain degree).. However, this is not to say that men can not take care of all these miscellaneous duties if they have no choice.. (after all, all men were once boys, and most boyz have at one stage in their lives handled such.. ).. Hence my point in my original post that men do not have to be \"DOMESTICATED\" in order to see the need to assist around the house.. they just have to see the need.. period..',\n",

But not all Nigerian Men need the \"domesticating\" Some are naturally \"domesticated\" .My husband is one that I am proud to say is an example. he joins and assists me a lot in domestic work. In fact, you hardly see him idle. He likes being busy with one thing or the other at anytime. For a woman, this kind of a man is a challenge.So in this case no need to domesticate him. rather I even ask him not to worry that I can handle anything. But he doesnt cook. I dont allow him do that if am around. Never. If both man and woman are working and come back late, it is left for the woman to plan the house work to suit the official work.

As with everything else, the more you read the Bible and meditate on it, the clearer the Holy Spirit makes what you read. Now with regards to praying amiss. I very strongly believe that what the Bible refers to here 'You get not because you pray amiss' is the fact that some people ask God for things that are so not biblical, hence, unacceptable and un-grantable. Whatever it is you want from God, the Bible emphatically says for you to pray to Him through His son Jesus Christ. He Himself said 'and whatever it is you want from God, ask it in my name and it shall be yours'. We can not compartmentalize our prayers, some to God and some to His Son Jesus Christ. An example of asking amiss is an unmarried or single woman praying for a child, God does not support that and such request may never be granted. A junior employee who is not ready to be corrected or adapt to company policy fervently praying for a promotion, a housewife coveting another's husband and praying for him to notice her in return.... all these are asking or praying amiss and those requests are never granted, at least not by God, of that I'm sure. But whatever request is biblical, whatever prayer seeks to promote and promulgate the goodnews of God, whatever our desires are that tally with God's wishes for our lives and those around us... these requests are best made to God through His Son and with a little patience where necessary and applicable, we are bound to get the full physical manifestation. 1 Like  \",\n",

People of many faiths \\'pray\\'; but what really is prayer for the Christian, and how can we strengthen our prayer lives?It is such a blessing to know that when we come to pray, we can come in the confidence of trusting God as our FATHER. Jesus said, \"When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven\" (Luke 11:2). This immediately brings us to a relationship and takes away the religiosity which so many people are accustomed.Another blessing of this relationship is that we are loved by the Father in exactly the same way that He loved the divine Son Jesus Christ. \"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love\" (John 15:9). What is it that the Father would deny the Son? Absolutely nothing! Think of it for a moment. \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\" (Rom. 8:32).At the basic level, when we come before God in prayer knowing that we are His children with whom He is pleased to give whatever we ask, our faith will be refreshed and strengthened. However, prayer is offered in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and with trusting confidence that we ask according to God\\'s will.To Him be glory for ever. 1 Like  ',\n",

However, i don\\'t count on that, what i count on is the friendship and electrifying spirit of music, that magnetizes musicians together.

As a jazz enthusiast, i was appreciating the works of these guys and where they have taken strings to. Femi Temowo is a musician that i will forever talk about, likewise Micheal. I know what they\\'ve gone through when it  comes to jazz music. I know the syllabus they\\'ve  faced for them to have that knowledge of jazz, It\\'s not easy! So Doshbass, if you go back to reading my post again, you will surely know you\\'ve misinterpreted my post. I\\'d like you to read it again and get what i was trying to point out. You said, \"well these guys are not known in Nigerian Community\". I know they are going to be among the leaders and Pioneers of Modern jazz in Africa in few years to come.Why is South-African Jazz growing everyday? I look forward to an answer from you.

But, I do hope that you\\'ll consider this:As I\\'m sure you know, the topic of jazz is truly vast.  It encompasses and embraces more than most of us could ever begin to comprehend.  That is why, sir, I ask that you consider staying around in this thread.  Your expreience in the realm is much needed and your knowledge is appreciated.  Consider that the French that is spoken in Paris is different that that spoken in Canada, Haiti or Madagascar.  But, it\\'s all still French.  The same may be said of jazz.  No matter what its era or manifestation, it must be kept alive through performance and, as is the case here, discussion.  No, Miller, not even true jazzers will agree on everything.  But we must assiduously continue to get the word out about all eras, all stylistic sensibilities, all instruments, voices--you name it.Let\\'s not let semantics get in the way of our keeping the art alive. Would you please reconsider and afford us the depth of your background in this thread?@donjohano:Indeed, few guitarists of any ilk have executed octaves with the dexterity an aplomb of Wes!',\n",

Tell that to Quincy Jones who put Big Daddy Kane, George Benson, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Kool Moe D, on one track in the \"Back on the Block\" album. The danger in all music criticism is the unncessary compartmentalization of different musical forms, and the further compartmentalization of forms within a particular genre such as \"Jazz\" which no two people can agree upon. I know people who regard anything after dixieland jazz as non-jazz. It doesn\\'t matter. What matters is you, the musician, you the listener. Do you dig it? That is the question.Even Louis Armstrong called Bebop \"Chinese music\". But that\\'s human nature - to differentiate, compartmentalize in all aspects of life - art in general, and of course, race (which has been a huge factor in the development of African-American music).

Well there is a condition which is the ability to be able to take care of the wife and the family financially and morally, but then again we shouldn't forget the issue of education which might arise and conflict with the family needs in the aspect of being there and all that. So I would say the best time is after secondary school providing the requirement is fullfilled.Well frankly then again, actually its really a very difficult issue to really tackle because we do have different values,  in terms of religious background and cultural values.In my University, we do have Iranians that are married, and studying with their wives and infact they are happy and I can see that, because they are always hanging out with each other and the brightness of their face says it all.

       "   {'text': \"Kazey has said it all really. I should simply buttress his point by saying there is no such thing as 'marriageable age'. As long as one is independent maturity wise (which in itself is a relative thing) and the financial means (without which the whole thing will be a joke) is readily available, then by all means, it's time to settle down. Having said that however, one needs to take into consideration the issue, I dare say the vital issue of raising kids. In my personal opinion, a lady who is younger than 20 might not necessarily be the best of mums to her kids largely because she is still so much a kid herself. Although there are women who are well over 30 and are still not the best mums. In any event, the 3 major factors I believe one needs to settle down will of course include a responsible and like minded man/woman (2) Maturity cum high sense of responsibility and last but not the least (3) financial independence. This does not exhaust the list by any chance but represent the basic things to look out for.Erm.... Seun, I'm precariously closer to 30 than I am to 25 and I am not married. That is not to say that I've been too choosy or picky, it's just that the 2 relationships I've ever had didn't turn out too well. I've still got deep emotional scares from the last one and it's been over a year. Armed with such invisible wares, one tends to shrink away from these things till you find the right person. It takes time for you to know that, hence my seeing someone now for the last few months and trying to see if we are indeed compatible or not. Touching briefly again on financial independence, the erroneous and outdated belief that a guy must earn and save so much before he gets married is completely untrue. Couples who genuinely love each other remain helpmates and pool their earnings and resources together to meet the needs of the home.Subjects as heavy as this are usually multifaceted, in that there are diverse sides of it for different people. The foregoing simply represents my personal view. 4 Likes   2 Shares\",\n",

Maybe you\\'ve been too picky?!\"I disagree with you brother, if you rush into marriage when you are not ready, you will rush out! I will be 30 by June 12, and for you information am not panicking, I\\'d better marry at 40 and live a happy life, than marry at 20 and stay unhappy for the rest of my life.I have had experiences in relationships, both good and bad.  We are in the modern age if you must know, and you don\\'t go into marriage because society demands or because your mates are married.  You marry because your are mentally, physically, financially, and most importantly emotionally ready. The ripe age for a woman in my opinion is from 21.  Take note: any woman who is desperate to get married will always end up with the wrong person.  It\\'s not an issue of being choosy or picky.  Maybe some of us have had one or two unfortunate  relationships, so we learn from our mistakes and they guide us in our future encounters.  The essential thing is, \\'marry your best friend\\'.  I learnt that from AYA, so I will remain unmarried until I find my best friend, anything worth doing is worth doing well. The reason for marriage in olden days was mostly so we can have children to help out in the farms, companionship then was secondary, a man can even marry more than one wife just to produce enough children. Now in the modern age, companionship (in my opinion, I stand to be corrected) is primary.  To have children in our society, you have to be financially ready - so it\\'s secondary.Since the basic thing is companionship, and the economic situation coupled with cultural demands about marriage don\\'t make things easy for couples ready for marriage to get married, it now make a lot of couples live together for ages, some even get children, before they now think of making their marriage official.  Just like Ra said, the onus falls on both partners now.  If you waiting for the ripe time, it might never come.  In essence what am saying is this: Nowadays we all enjoy companionship even if we are not married (boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, live-in lovers etc.) therefore marriage keeps getting postponed and delayed. 6 Likes   1 Share',\n",

       "   {'text': 'I want to be sensitive,  but this has to stop.I do not agree with the idea that women should get married in their late 20s or early 30s.  You make it sound as if when you feel you are ready you can just go to a supermarket and pick up a man.  I don\\'t think it can be that easy.When you are in your early twenties, or even just above eighteen, there are lots of suitors:- Boys your age want to go out with you.- Men slightly older than you want to go out with you.- Single or divorced men much older than you want to go out with you!So at this level the girl gets a lot of attention.  This is the age at which the phrase \"every girl has a suitor\" is actually true.When you are in your very late twenties or thirties, this is the case:- The \\'good\\' men your age are engaged.  Taken.- Men slightly older than you are married.- Men much older than you are \\'old men\\' as far as you are concerned.The few single men are still going to be dating women in their early twenties, as well as people closer to your age (I would)!  And to make matters worse, your \\'taste\\' would have improved, with all the extra education and work experience.  This is when ladies start having serious doubts about whether it\\'s  \"ok to date married men\".The point is this.  If men are getting married at 25, women have to get married at 23.  If men are getting married at 28, 29 then women have to get married at 24, 25.  Because men will not date women who are older than them, but we would gladly date women who are much younger.  As far as I know, the most eligible men get married earlier than the \\'strugglers\\' and \\'players\\' you are trying to avoid.A lady should not prepare for marriage by \\'waiting\\' for maturity.  You should prepare for it by getting matured faster.  Now exactly how is one to get matured faster?  We\\'ll have to the relationship experts, but I don\\'t think it means burying yourself in a demanding career or field of study while your friends are dating and getting married! 3 Likes  ',\n",

I am 28. I got married @ 26 (same age with my wife). I must confess to u we are both enjoying every bit of it (including the 'grey areas' - occassional financial difficulties, family intirgues etc).However, I agree to all the submissions about maturity as in financial independence, emotional maturity, high sense of responsibility, management skills (including home politics) etc. But I think where we need to start tackling the issues from the root. All had to do with growing asap to handle issues on your own.One basic problem I think we are having is that we get matured rather slowly these days. By 18years, say, after your secondary school education, u should start working to earn money by urself. Even if ur parents still sponsor u, u should start getting ur own independece from there. This will make u start taking decisions independently, facing 'real world' problems and tackling it urself, getting accountable and responsible for your own decisions. This will evidently train u for the future-when u 'll be all alone.In contrary, I think we lean too much on our parents, that we have problem 'dettaching away from them'.Having said that, the word, Right does not necessary mean an absolute value(s), there are exceptions. By that I mean, its not everybody that will necessarily marry @ that age (that does not necessarily portend luck or ill-luck). But it need be said here that we should all make a move towards marrying early enough-thats where the real life begins, whether to enjoy companionship or to bear children among other reasons. Thats the hard fact. Don't be an escapist!By my own little exposure, I think a lady should marry (ideally btw ages 23 and 27) and a man (btw ages 26 and 30). Mark my words, IDEAL. Not everything works by the ideals you have to face the reality. I am neither an idealist nor a realist. I'm a PRAGMATIST.

How many of us are willing to solve problems as they arise and not bear a grudge waiting for a dam to build before we explode? \\xa0How many of us are ready to avoid the me first attitude and put our mate's interests ahead of ours?

You mentioned that it is best to get married at 30 or so, what exactly makes that an age that a guy can\\'t hold off any longer, as you already stated that young people in love face a compuilsion to marry. . .  who exactly sets that hold-off-no-longer-age? Some people can\\'t hold off any longer at age 21. I can hold off till age 90, I\\'m that willed. If your position were to be true, everyone would marry their first love.Laws of perception flaw the \\'one shoe fits all\\' theory, and on every ground. For instance, in America, at 18, your parents are kicking you out of the house. You\\'re paying your college fees. You\\'re getting your own apartment, you\\'re \\'discovering\\' yourself. You\\'re prepping your religious mask, or even glueing it to your face (quite early). You\\'ve impregnated your girlfriend, and she\\'s having a baby boy. HA! If that\\'s what you mean by maturity, hmmm.In Naija, you\\'re a baby till you\\'re done with college, your mom still washes your clothes. You still ask your dad for tuition money. Even when you\\'re done, you go to your parents to help you find a girl, or you announce it to your friends to keep an eye out for you. you\\'re making N100,000 a month. If that\\'s maturity, hmmm.If maturity is embracing religion, and becoming born again, the we\\'re presented with another logical fallacy-- because religion doesn\\'t go hand in hand with effective problem solving.So I guess the question is \"what is maturity?\" The answer is: your definition. if you don\\'t think you\\'re mature, then don\\'t even think about marriage. Anyone can get married at any age, if the law allows you to. The question is rather: \"what age is one \\'mature\\' enough to handle the challenges of marriage?\" 3 Likes  ',\n",

I equally know alot of people who marrid in their 20's and could not conceive until their 30's and even 40's. The most important thing is marrying at God's time not man made time. After all children come from God. I know atleast 3 people who were told they will never be able to conceive by so called medical doctors. Well guess what? They have healthy children today. One reason I stayed away from Naija people when I was singly back in the day and still do is their over sabi when it comes to issues of marraige, child bearing and the likes. You people are not God. Allow God's will to be done in people's lives and things will fall into place accordingly like it should. That is how you people rush in and by the time you hit 50, you are either divorced or looking for a younger woman to marry. Marraige amongst Africans and especially Naijas is mostly a mess and a scam; no mutual respect, no love, no affection; more like a master/slave relationship. Tufia!

       "    'quoted_text': \"HiI just stumbled on this topic and deciced to make a contribution.I agree that marriage has a lot to do with financial stability,maturity,love,and above all God's plan for you but ladies should have it at the back of their minds that your chances of childbearing are reduced as your age increases.Medically,ladies in their early to mid twenties stand a better chance(25%) chance of conception every month while those from their mid-twenties to early thirties have a 20% chance.those in their mid thirties have a 15% chance and when a woman starts having children at that age,that's when you might have cases of down syndrome,slowpoke children and so on considering that you will space your childrens age,its always good to start on time but that doesn't mean that if you havent found Mr Right you should become desperate.Work on your reasoning and dont wait for maturity,you can attain it by being logical in your reasoning.So for the ladies,pray to God to get married say in your early to mid 20's cos i know of a lady who got married at 20 only to have fertility issues that lasted for 10years.She had her 1st child at 30 so due to her early  marriage she didnt have much to loose as most of her mates who got married at late20's/early 30's just had about the same number of kids.Guys when you are financially stable and ready for a lifelong commitment to one special lady,That's your own ideal age.\",\n",

It was better than ANY i have EVER had, and that covers both the UK and the US!!!I could go just for the popcorn alone!Another big plus for Silverbird is that in the complex is a joint called Cubes which is like a bar where people can hang out and dance, while very pricey it was a classy joint.I give Silverbird a classy 8/10 \",\n",

It is usually a whole day's affair so I can't go there just to watch a film. My neighbor went there sometime ago with his kids (they watched Shark Tale). He spent so much time in the traffic jam to and fro and had to spend a lot of money buying the kids snacks on the way. He said it was a great place but he wouldn't go through all that stress to watch a movie again.I watched Shark Tale sometime later in my house and had the luxury of going back whenever I missed something.Silverbird is a great place for those who live near or happen to be in the area, but for those who live far, I think it isn't worth the time and expenses. Once silverbird starts advertising/showing a film, u can be sure it is already on sale. So u can try buying the film and watching it in the comfort of your home instead: film- 300, popcorn- 30, coke- 120; total- 450.\",\n",

       "   {'text': \"Silverbird isn't the only cinema in Nigeria and this should answer your question'It’s wrong to think that Silverbird Cinema is all about foreign movies' Saturday, May 27, 2006Established two years ago, the Sliverbird Cinema has proved to be a centre of movie excellence. It has succeeded in reviving the cinema culture in Lagos. it has even gone further than this. Now, a movie buff can sit relaxedly and enjoy his favourite flick in a comfortable environment, with his wife and children in tow. How has it been in the last two years? Blockbuster spoke with Mr Jide Azumah, General Manager, Silverbird Galleria. Excerpts: It has been a very long road in the last two years because there was no precedent. We had to set a precedent to match our own standard. We made sure from day one that we were not guided by the so-called Nigerian standard. The impression we are trying to create in this country is for people to get value for their money like when they visit a place like this in any part of the world. Bold moves The history of Silverbird is replete with bold moves. Silverbird has a track record of working in uncharted waters. When we started 25 years ago with music promotion we were told that we wanted to do what nobody had done before. As young boys, we all grew up going to the cinema. We still have fond memories of the cinema. Now, it is a big shame that the only time we can enjoy good movies is when we travel outside Nigeria. For this reason, my chairman (Ben Bruce) decided to bring back the cinema culture. Today, there is a place a family can go for relaxation and that is the Silverbird Cinema. We have created an environment that we used to enjoy when we were growing up. Silverbird Cinema and foreign movies It is wrong for people to think that Silverbird Cinema is all about foreign movies. We are a 35mm cinema exhibition outfit. Nollywood does not shoot movies on celluloid. But what we have done is to invest on digital projectors to accommodate Nollywood movies that are converted to DVDs. Now, I am glad that a movie has just been produced on celluloid in Nigeria. It is entitled ìAmazing Graceî. We are looking forward to exhibiting the film. Challenges The number one challenge is that we have done what nobody has done. So, we had to set the pace. The fact that people are not used to this is also a problem. It is quite demanding to train people. But I am very proud that we are the first service company fully in the hands of Nigerians. This I believe is an achievement. It is very challenging to get people to act properly within an environment such as this. Management style It is simple. My style is leadership by example. There is nothing I ask my staff to do that I cannot do. I am here 18 hrs a day almost throughout the week. When I get to the office at 6.30am, I may not leave until 10 or 11pm. My staff is also committed. It is not just telling people to do it but showing them how to do it. Motivation Success motivates me. They say nothing succeeds like success. I must excel in everything that I do. Failure is an anathema. It doesnít exist in my dictionary. I thank God that today I have succeeded in all the tasks placed before me. Expansion plans We are building a Galleria in Abuja. We now have two centres. Within the next 2 years we will be in Bayelsa, Port Harcourt and precisely in Ikeja, Lagos.

Call or wh at app me Patrick 090 25 71 23 07QuestionS What is the success rate of the robot in percentage?Answer With this robot you can be sure of an average of 10%+ profits every month. And we are being modest not to overhype things. You see it depends on market conditions. Some months u will get 50%,40%,35%,60%+ it depend some factorsAs a Forex trader in the past I never try b o ts. B o t s blow up your account.Do you know why ?1. They are trying to predict the direction of the market2. Leverage is an issue. Royal Q focuses on purely spot trading. Where u buy low and sell high. But the new updated version now has futures trading added to it with good risk management and money management also.Royal Q doesn't predict the direction of the  of the market.If you understand this then that will eliminate your worries... What is the worse thing that can happen if royal Q crash?The  worst thing that can happen is that your coins remain with you in bi na nce. No loss. U sell ur coins on bi na nce wen u want and get ur money out. Except bi na nce crash? Thats when u look ur money. & bi na nce is the worlds highest c r y p to ex changer. Just like C B N is the nigeiran master bank. Bi na nce is the cr y p to master bankThis app will be here for a long time. Hav no fears. Its a 3years+ now.Question how easy to withdraw into naira bank account?Answer Very very easy. Hundreds of Agents are waiting to buy U S D T from you on Bin an ce, via the P 2 P Platform. Among us are Agent on Bin an ce and De riv that transacts in U S D T . Cash out will not be an issue.Question Is the cost of d Bot  120$ +20$Or just 120$Answer The bot costs $120 for 12 months.However recall that for every successful trade the app will take 20% of the  profit it generates and gives u 80%. While ur capital is 100% intact.Since it cannot touch your money on bi na nce we ask you to put $20 atleast for fuel fee inside the apps usdt for it will be deducting the fe es from there.Only when successful tra des happen will it start deducting from the fuel.Re cruitment is optional & is the 2nd way of making money aside tra ding..If you don't have much capital you can start raising fund to trade via the net working.Question  Doesn't someone need to be online constantly 4 d robot to keep trading?? As in, what if my phone goes off 4 a while due to maybe low ba3. Hope d robot keeps working?Answer In fact you can uninstall the app on  your phone and the app will keep working. Anytime you come into network you get updates.Questions Must you verify your bin an ce account b4 joining?Answer Yes  for bin an ce.no for royal Q, You can just do the email and phone number verification and then start trading.Question What are the associated risk using Royal Q Ro bot? Answer There is risk in every opportunity.If bin an ce the biggest c r y p t o exchange decides to run away with our money then that's it. But if Royal Q crash? Ur money is still in bi na nce safe.When Royal Q trades for you it takes 20% of each successful trade profit as gas fee. Since it cannot touch your binance money it deducts from its internal u s d t wallet. So u drop the money there and say transport money to go to the market and trade for me.  Remember that with Royal Q your money remains safe in your bin an ce account.QuestionDoes this Royal Q app loose on trades?Answer This app trades the spot market and recently started trading Futures. It doesn't use leverage on spot trading. No losses. So as long as you hold your position you remain without loss. No Liquidating because of impatience.. Never liquidate when the trade is negative. The coins u are holding will remain the same always.Whatever goes down will come up. So you must have some patience In the Business and in cr yp to at large. & start with spare money dat u can leave to work for u for 6-12months.Without wanting the capital out in a rush. While u can be taking profits 1s it hits 20$ and above. do not borrow to start. Or use ur schoolfees or house rent or the likes of such emergency funds to avoid panic & rush. Use your spare money that you would have saved in the bank to invest here, or except you want to network and you are capable of net working then you can do otherwise with caution. this is a honest advice most will not open up to youDo you have any other questions? Call or wh at app me Patrick 090 25 71 23 07To  share your thoughts,fears or doubt & incase you need more information and wish to get started contact me .Call or whatapp me To get started.090 25 71 23 07Take this business Serious..WowSom of u stil feel this business has crashed.But it has not.\"}]},\n",

Energy Efficiency: Utilizing energy-efficient technologies and designs, such as LED lighting and advanced insulation, to reduce energy consumption.2. Renewable Materials: Using eco-friendly, renewable, and locally sourced materials in construction, decreasing the carbon footprint.3. Water Conservation: Implementing water-saving fixtures and systems to reduce water usage within buildings.4. Passive Design: Incorporating passive design strategies like natural lighting and ventilation to reduce the need for artificial heating and cooling.Sustainable building practices not only benefit the environment but also lead to lower operating costs and healthier living and working environments.

My mind raced like a sportscar as I tried to find a parallel between the bombs on Gaza and the bombs on Biafra. There’s no doubt that any mention of Biafra brings sad and sorrowful memories to anybody who lived through the Nigerian Civil War. My wife and I lived through it.  \"I was thinking about the bombs Israel is dropping on Gaza and reflexively reliving the horror of the bombs the Egyptians who piloted Russian MiG fighters for Nigeria dropped on us in Biafra. No difference, except that ours in Biafra wasn’t on live television.\" \"War is bad,\" she told me.\"True, and I recall vividly that particular air raid at Awgu during the Nigeria-Biafra war.”“The one you described in your book, First Is Last?”“Yes.”“You told that story many times, even before your book. I believe it’s one of those sad experiences one has to live with forever.”“True,” I said. “Enugu, the capital of Biafra, had just fallen to the Nigerians, and just as the Palestinians were being forced out of their homes, we were forced out of Enugu with our life belongings in head bundles. After trekking for about two days, we ended up in a refugee camp in Awgu, some miles from Enugu. We were in this refugee camp when the Nigerian planes came. What happened that day, as you already noted, will live with me forever.” “... the air raid siren went off. The siren was by now a familiar sound. With lightning speed, everybody dashed into the well-known bushes to take cover. But this was an air raid that would forever live with Chinedu. The bombers flew low, dropping bombs randomly over the city of Awgu. The Biafran divisions defending Enugu had retreated to Awgu. Ka, ka, ka, gbim, gbim, gbim. That was the familiar sound of the fighter bomber. From where he took cover under a tree, Chinedu observed a vast smoke screen from a crate that formed about 50 yards away. There was blood all over the place. Limbs, legs, arms, and other human body parts littered the field like garbage. A bomb had directly hit a poorly constructed bunker, where scores of people had taken cover. This war was getting worse by the day. Chinedu had never seen human body parts littered in this manner, and he, too, could have been a casualty. His father, taking cover about ten trees away, had been refused entry into the bunker because the bunker had no space by the time he arrived. After an hour of sustained attack, the air raid ended. The air raid killed everybody in the bunker instantly. Although properly camouflaged, the bunker sustained a direct hit. Were the enemy bombers targeting civilians, or did they think the camp housed soldiers? The dropped bombs wiped off families instantly, leaving those alive in shock and disbelief. No one could identify many of the dead. There was wailing and crying, and people were desperate, with a sense of hopelessness in the air.  But many had also lost the will or ability to cry. The tragedy and loss were beyond their comprehension. Mazi Iloka, a man Mazi Nwafor and his family met in the camp, sat numb, his elbows anchored on his thigh, supporting both palms carrying his chin. His appearance indicated his hopelessness, and he looked feeble as a child. Everybody in the camp knew him; the Nigerians killed his son Chukwuma recently in the Nsukka sector. Chukwuma was an Engineering senior at the University of Nigeria Nsukka before the outbreak of the war. Mazi Iloka’s wife, Maria, and her other four children died in the bunker. Mazi Iloka was left alone. A family of seven only two weeks ago was now a family of one. The world had collapsed under Mazi Iloka’s feet. His life was finished and was no longer worth living. He sat numb and dumb, unable to accept condolences. The following morning, Mazi Iloka was hanging from a tree. He had committed suicide. Among the Igbo, suicide was taboo. They buried those who committed suicide after some atonement to the gods. But this was war. Everyone in the camp knew Mazi Iloka’s story, so no one commented on the taboo associated with suicide. Finally, some courageous men came together, brought down the hanging body, and buried it in a grave they hurriedly dug. Biafra was at war, and everyone knew that the future looked bleak for Biafra.\"(Excerpted from “First Is Last,” Chapter 11) '}]},\n",

And we are being modest not to overhype things. You see it depends on market conditions. Some months u will get 50%,40%,35%,60%+ it depend some factorsAs a Forex trader in the past I never try b o ts. B o t s blow up your account.Do you know why ?1. They are trying to predict the direction of the market2. Leverage is an issue. Royal Q focuses on purely spot trading. Where u buy low and sell high. But the new updated version now has futures trading added to it with good risk management and money management also.Royal Q doesn't predict the direction of the  of the market.If you understand this then that will eliminate your worries... What is the worse thing that can happen if royal Q crash?The  worst thing that can happen is that your coins remain with you in bi na nce. No loss. U sell ur coins on bi na nce wen u want and get ur money out. Except bi na nce crash? Thats when u look ur money. & bi na nce is the worlds highest c r y p to ex changer. Just like C B N is the nigeiran master bank. Bi na nce is the cr y p to master bankThis app will be here for a long time. Hav no fears. Its a 3years+ now.Question how easy to withdraw into naira bank account?Answer Very very easy. Hundreds of Agents are waiting to buy U S D T from you on Bin an ce, via the P 2 P Platform. Among us are Agent on Bin an ce and De riv that transacts in U S D T . Cash out will not be an issue.Question Is the cost of d Bot  120$ +20$Or just 120$Answer The bot costs $120 for 12 months.However recall that for every successful trade the app will take 20% of the  profit it generates and gives u 80%. While ur capital is 100% intact.Since it cannot touch your money on bi na nce we ask you to put $20 atleast for fuel fee inside the apps usdt for it will be deducting the fe es from there.Only when successful tra des happen will it start deducting from the fuel.Re cruitment is optional & is the 2nd way of making money aside tra ding..If you don't have much capital you can start raising fund to trade via the net working.Question  Doesn't someone need to be online constantly 4 d robot to keep trading?? As in, what if my phone goes off 4 a while due to maybe low ba3. Hope d robot keeps working?Answer In fact you can uninstall the app on  your phone and the app will keep working. Anytime you come into network you get updates.Questions Must you verify your bin an ce account b4 joining?Answer Yes  for bin an ce.no for royal Q, You can just do the email and phone number verification and then start trading.Question What are the associated risk using Royal Q Ro bot? Answer There is risk in every opportunity.If bin an ce the biggest c r y p t o exchange decides to run away with our money then that's it. But if Royal Q crash? Ur money is still in bi na nce safe.When Royal Q trades for you it takes 20% of each successful trade profit as gas fee. Since it cannot touch your binance money it deducts from its internal u s d t wallet. So u drop the money there and say transport money to go to the market and trade for me.  Remember that with Royal Q your money remains safe in your bin an ce account.QuestionDoes this Royal Q app loose on trades?Answer This app trades the spot market and recently started trading Futures. It doesn't use leverage on spot trading. No losses. So as long as you hold your position you remain without loss. No Liquidating because of impatience.. Never liquidate when the trade is negative. The coins u are holding will remain the same always.Whatever goes down will come up. So you must have some patience In the Business and in cr yp to at large. & start with spare money dat u can leave to work for u for 6-12months.Without wanting the capital out in a rush. While u can be taking profits 1s it hits 20$ and above. do not borrow to start. Or use ur schoolfees or house rent or the likes of such emergency funds to avoid panic & rush. Use your spare money that you would have saved in the bank to invest here, or except you want to network and you are capable of net working then you can do otherwise with caution. this is a honest advice most will not open up to youDo you have any other questions?

I was calling her but she was not responding. I had to go back to check on her.“I went to check on her, she was not moving at all. She was very stiff and strong. After that, I did not know what to do, I had to carry her body into another room, and then I called my brother to come to my place.“He came, and then he took me out of the place. He did not know there was anybody in my house. He took me to his place. That was where I received my treatment.“I was thinking if I report the issue, I will be blamed for everything. So, I was trying to wrap her body and get rid of it, which was very wrong of me to do.“As I came back that Wednesday to come and wrap her body, that was the Wednesday the police came. I did not remove any of her body parts.”He noted that their relationship was not stable.The suspect added that the deceased took a Bolt ride to his house on her own, noting that she was supposed to leave the same night but he slept off.On his part, John Otuene, the elder brother to the slain 20-year-old girl, said his family wants justice to prevail on the matter.“On Wednesday, we got a call that a case of a dead person had been reported to the Ozuoba Police Station and that we should go to the Police Station.“So, I reported to the IPO at Mini-Okoro Police station. We reported to the commander. The commander gave the IPO a go-ahead.“All of us went to the Ozuoba Police Station and they met the officer there who confirmed that the missing person in the picture is the person that was killed.“I need justice.

       "    'quoted_text': 'By Abdullateef AliyuThe Group Chief Executive Officer of Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Mesfin Tasew has provided an insight into the involvement of the East African Airline in the setting up of Nigeria Air, saying the airline almost withdrew but the government insisted it should continue with the process.This is the first time the Ethiopian Airlines leadership would speak on the controversy over the airline which dogged the last minutes of the immediate past administration.Former Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika had floated the airline on May 27 which did not see the light of the day as it was later discovered that a plane belonging to ET was used to conduct a demonstration flight against the dictate of the process for the establishment of a new airline.Daily Trust reports that the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) had sued the Federal Government challenging the selection of Ethiopian Airlines as the preferred bidders to midwife the proces.But speaking with some Nigerian journalists in Addis Ababa, the Airline’s CEO stated that the East African carrier never had any plan to set up an airline in Nigeria but was invited by the federal government to partner with it to establish a national carrier, Nigeria Air.It also explained that the federal government requested that the Nigeria Air logo be painted on the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft be painted for inspection and the airline agreed.FG asked us to paint our aircraft Nigeria logo for Nigeria Air unveiling“At one point, that leadership of Nigeria Air, which doesn’t include Ethiopian Airlines, asked us to bring aircraft painted with Nigerian logo to facilitate the progress of the Air Operators’ Certificate. So, we agreed with that, we took out one of our aircraft, we painted it with Nigerian logo, we flew it, it was for demonstration by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) for their inspection. So, after two days, we brought back the aircraft, repainted it with Ethiopian logo and it is flying. So, while we were here, waiting for the decision of the court, now there was a change of government that took place.”He said the airline at first resisted the invitation to set up the airline but later agreed due to long relationship it has with Nigeria where it operates to four cities.He said while Ethiopian Airlines and the Nigeran government were preparing the shareholding, it received message that some companies and airlines in Nigeria were defaming Ethiopian Airlines and the federal government and had gone to court and obtained a court order to stop the establishment of Nigeria Air.This prompted Ethiopian Airlines to want to withdraw, but the Nigerian government insisted that it should continue the process of establishing the national carrier for the most populous nation in Africa.The Group Chief Executive Officer of Ethiopian Airlines said that until now the airline had not decided whether to continue the process to establish Nigeria Air but the federal government said it should continue with the groundwork until the court vacates the order, insisting that it was not cancelling the project.Tasew emphasized that Nigeria Air was already established before Ethiopian Airlines was invited to partner with it.He also noted that Nigerians would benefit hugely from the national carrier if eventually established because the federal government said that Nigeria does not have dependable airlines in the domestic and international market.Tasew said, “Ethiopian Airlines didn’t have any intention or plan to setup an airline in Nigeria. In May of 2022, when I took my current responsibility (as Group CEO), a request came from the Nigerian government asking ET (Ethiopian Airlines) to participate in a bid and help the Nigerian government to set up a Nigerian flag carrier. It came in writing.“Initially we didn’t want to go into that. We said we have other initiatives in other countries and we were busy. But the Nigerian government insisted that Ethiopian Airlines is an African airline, it has to help the Nigerian government in setting up the national carrier. So, we had to respect them. We serve the Nigerian public and government by flying to four cities in Nigeria; we couldn’t say no, we cannot come and help you. So, we had to submit proposal, we had to respect the Nigerian government.“And we thought that the Nigerian government had choices, ET being one; because they had also requested other airlines in the Middle East, Europe to participate in the bid. I don’t know whether they participated or not. We submitted our proposal and we received a letter from the Ministry of Aviation, saying that Ethiopian Airlines has been selected to be a partner to set up the airline.“Then the Nigerian government wanted the structure of investors to be Nigerian investing institutions and the Nigerian government wanted only 5 per cent shares to ensure that they have presence in the airline and to facilitate the establishment of the airline. We had a lot of discussions, we agreed but we had some differences in some points. ‘How Nigerian Airlines, firms started defaming Ethiopian Government, Airline’“And while we were preparing the shareholder agreement, then we heard that some companies in Nigeria including airlines started defaming and objecting the establishment of the airline and defaming the name of the government and Ethiopian Airlines. At that time, we thought that if the Nigerian government doesn’t want it, the Nigerian public doesn’t want it, we could as well withdraw.“But the Nigerian government insisted that no, that this is a strategic issue for Nigeria and we have to continue. When this group of people went to court, and brought a court order, we had to defend ourselves, we had to go to the court, together with the Nigerian government, including the Ministry of Transport.“We had to defend ourselves. So, until now, it is not yet decided, as far as we know, it is under the court. But the Nigerian government insisted that we had to continue the background work until the court case gets decision.“Nigeria Air was established before us; it is already established by the Nigerian government before we were invited. It has its own leadership, it was doing a lot of things, it had started requesting for the Air Operators’ Certificate (AOC), making preparations. So, when we came in, it was a matter of restructuring the ownership of that Nigeria Air. For your information, the logo was already defined by them, it was not by Ethiopian Airlines. And we thought that if Nigeria Air is established, the benefit will be for Nigerian public, for Nigerian government.“Because when we talked to the Nigerian government, why do you want to set up a new airline? They said they don’t have dependable airlines within Nigeria and they wanted an airline that can provide dependable service that departs and arrives on time; that doesn’t cancel flights on the domestic market and also on the international market.“The Nigerian government believes that airfares charged by foreign airlines are so high that the Nigerian public is at a disadvantage. So, the intention of the Nigerian government was to set up a very, very strong, reliable, dependable national carrier that services both the domestic market and the international. And we believe in it. that is why we wanted to move forward with it.”Tasew said the federal government promised to get back to Ethiopian Airlines with a decision and the East African carrier agreed.“In the first place, it was not our initiative, it was the initiative of the government. Now, if the government wants us to cancel the project, it is fine with us. We have no problem. If the government want us to continue with the project, the government has to solve the legal case in court. Otherwise, we are willing to support the Nigerian government in the establishment of the national carrier. So, we leave the decision to the Nigerian government.“We have no issues; we will not be disappointed if it is cancelled. We are just there to help. And if the parties ask us to help, change their mind, change its strategy, we are fine with that. This is what we told the Minister; that we respect whatever decision of the Nigerian government.”‘We’ve no intention to kill Nigerian airlines’“But in our opinion, what has been said in the media is completely wrong. If we go there, our goal is not to kill Nigerian airlines, absolutely not. We have no intention of killing Nigerian airlines. Definitely we have to set up a reliable airline, we have to provide the service that fits the needs of the Nigerian public.

       "    'quoted_text': 'The leadership of Ethiopian Airlines has opened up on the controversy over the Nigerian Air initiative of the past administration of Former President Muhammadu Buhari.POLITICS NIGERIA recalls that the former Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had floated the airline on May 27.However, it was later discovered that an aircraft belonging to Ethiopian Airlines was used to conduct a demonstration flight. The Nigerian airline eventually did not survive and was eventually halted by the new administration of Bola Tinubu.In a fresh development, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Mesfin Tasew has revealed that the airline almost withdrew from the Nigeria Air project, but the Nigerian government insisted that it should continue.Speaking to Nigerian journalists in Addis Ababa, Tasew said that Ethiopian Airlines was invited by the Nigerian government to partner in establishing a national carrier, but the airline was initially reluctant.“We at first resisted the invitation to set up the airline but later agreed due to long relationship we have with Nigeria where we operate to four cities,” Tasew said.However, Tasew said that Ethiopian Airlines was prompted to want to withdraw from the project after it received messages that some companies and airlines in Nigeria were defaming the airline and the Nigerian government and had gone to court to obtain a court order to stop the establishment of Nigeria Air.“This prompted Ethiopian Airlines to want to withdraw, but the Nigerian government insisted that it should continue the process of establishing the national carrier for the most populous nation in Africa,” Tasew said.Tasew said that Ethiopian Airlines has not yet decided whether to continue with the process of establishing Nigeria Air, but the Nigerian government has said that it should continue with the groundwork until the court vacates the order and it addresses some concerns.Tasew also emphasised that Nigeria Air was already established before Ethiopian Airlines was invited to partner with it.“Nigeria Air was already established before Ethiopian Airlines was invited to partner with it. We were invited to come and help them establish the airline,” Tasew said.Tasew said that Nigerians will benefit hugely from the national carrier if it is eventually established, as the federal government has said that Nigeria does not have dependable airlines in the domestic and international markets.“The national carrier will be a huge benefit to Nigerians,” Tasew said. “It will provide Nigerians with reliable and affordable air travel options.”Tasew added, “Ethiopian Airlines didn’t have any intention or plan to setup an airline in Nigeria. In May, of 2022, when I took my current responsibility (as Group CEO), a request came from the Nigerian government asking ET (Ethiopian Airlines) to participate in a bid and help the Nigerian government to setup a Nigerian flag carrier. It came in writing.“Initially we didn’t want to go into that. We said we have other initiatives in other countries and we were busy. But the Nigerian government insisted that Ethiopian Airlines is an African airline, it has to help the Nigerian government in setting up the national carrier. So, we had to respect them. We serve the Nigerian public and government by flying to four cities in Nigeria; we couldn’t say no, we cannot come and help you. So, we had to submit proposal, we had to respect the Nigerian government.“And we thought that the Nigerian government had choices, ET being one; because they had also requested other airlines in the Middle East, Europe to participate in the bid. I don’t know whether they participated or not. We submitted our proposal and we received a letter from the Ministry of Aviation, saying that Ethiopian Airlines has been selected to be a partner to set up the airline.“Then the Nigerian government wanted the structure of investors to be Nigerian investing institutions and the Nigerian government wanted only 5 percent shares to ensure that they have presence in the airline and to facilitate the establishment of the airline. We had a lot of discussions, we agreed but we had some differences in some points.“And while we were preparing the shareholder agreement, then we heard that some companies in Nigeria including airlines started defaming and objecting the establishment of the airline and defaming the name of the government and Ethiopian Airlines. At that time, we thought that if the Nigerian government doesn’t want it, the Nigerian public doesn’t want it, we could as well withdraw.“But the Nigerian government insisted that no, that this is a strategic issue for Nigeria and we have to continue. When these group of people went to court, and brought a court order, we had to defend ourselves, we had to go to the court, together with the Nigerian government, including the Ministry of Transport.“We had to defend ourselves. So, until now, it is not yet decided, as far as we know, it is under the court. But the Nigerian government insisted that we had to continue the background work until the court case gets decision.“Nigeria Air was established before us; it is already established by the Nigerian government before we were invited. It has its own leadership, it was doing a lot of things, it had started requesting for the Air Operators’ Certificate (AOC), making preparations. So, when we came in, it was a matter of restructuring the ownership of that Nigeria Air. For your information, the logo was already defined by them, it was not by Ethiopian Airlines. And we thought that if Nigeria Air is established, the benefit will be for Nigerian public, for Nigerian government.“Because when we talked to the Nigerian government, why do you want to set up a new airline? They said they don’t have dependable airlines within Nigeria and they wanted an airline that can provide dependable service that departs and arrives on time; that doesn’t cancel flights on the domestic market and also on the international market.“The Nigerian government believes that airfares charged by foreign airlines are so high that the Nigerian public is at a disadvantage. So, the intention of the Nigerian government was to set up a very, very strong, reliable, dependable national carrier that services both the domestic market and the international. And we believe in it. that is why we wanted to move forward with it.”“In the first place, it was not our initiative, it was the initiative of the government. Now, if the government wants us to cancel the project, it is fine with us. We have no problem. If the government want us to continue with the project, the government has to solve the legal case in court. Otherwise, we are willing to support the Nigerian government in the establishment of the national carrier. So, we leave the decision to the Nigerian government.“We have no issues; we will not be disappointed if it is cancelled. We are just there to help. And if the parties ask us to help, change their mind, change its strategy, we are fine with that. This is what we told the Minister; that we respect whatever decision of the Nigerian government.”“But in our opinion, what has been said in the media is completely wrong. If we go there, our goal is not to kill Nigerian airlines, absolutely not. We have no intention of killing Nigerian airlines. Definitely we have to set up a reliable airline, we have to provide the service that fits the needs of the Nigerian public. In fact, they have to be strong. If these airlines cannot be strong, they cannot compete. If they cannot compete, then some of them can go out of business. It is not peculiar to air transport business, in any business where there is competition. The stronger ones will grow, the weak ones will get dwarfed.“So, a strong airline will force the other airlines to revisit their efficiency. To revisit their operation, to provide more dependable service from which at the end of the day the Nigerian pubic will benefit. So, they said if Ethiopian Airlines comes, it will kill us, no.

Onyejeocha believes that the Isikwuato/Umunneochi Federal Constituency is her chiefdom, however, the result of that election altered all the plans and permutation for Onyejeocha who saw her ambition drifting.“For her to be the Speaker she must first win the seat at the Reps and Amobi Ogah was the only stumbling block.

Senators must take the issues with all seriousness it deserves.”The Deputy Senate President stressed that “It is very important that a thorough investigation should be done to make sure that everything that we need to know is brought open to us. ”“Who are those who are sabotaging the efforts of government? Anybody who has a hand,  sabotaging the efforts of the government to bring these refineries into operation and those who have taken money that is meant to turn around these refineries must be brought to book.

Powered by the Beneficiary Identity Management Service (BIMS), this initiative is set to radically transform the landscape of tertiary education in Nigeria.TERAS is more than just a digital platform; it's a comprehensive ecosystem aimed at expanding and enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of education services. Sonny Echono, the TETFund Executive Secretary, highlighted the transformative capacity of TERAS in bringing quality education within easy reach of millions of students and educators across the country.BIMS's role is pivotal. Designed to be a cornerstone of the TERAS ecosystem, BIMS ensures seamless access for over two million students and academic staff. This number is expected to surge past three million by year’s end, each benefiting from the easy access to a wealth of academic resources and research materials.The inception of TERAS is rooted in the tumultuous period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time that brought the global education system to a standstill. This disruption underscored the urgent need for a robust and resilient educational infrastructure. Spearheaded by the Federal Ministry of Education, and fuelled by strategic policies and innovations in ICT, the TERAS ecosystem emerged as a comprehensive solution.ICT's role is cardinal in TERAS’s innovation, with technology being meticulously integrated to ensure educators and students are not just connected but are also equipped with tools that foster a conducive learning environment. This integration is anticipated to cultivate a globally competitive workforce, adept at addressing national challenges and exploiting international opportunities.Minister of Education, Prof. Tahir Mamman, at the unveiling of TERAS, extolled TETFund for its innovative approach. He underscored the ecosystem's capability in countering academic disruptions, highlighting the central role BIMS plays in ensuring that education remains a continuous and accessible journey for every student and educator.Prof. Yakubu Ochefu, the Secretary General of the Committee of Vice Chancellors (CVC), not only lauded the efforts of Sonny Echono but also underscored the collaborative spirit of the CVC and individual Vice Chancellors. Their collective input has been instrumental in the development and deployment of the TERAS ecosystem.Diving deeper into the functionalities of TERAS reveals a meticulously crafted platform designed to adapt to the dynamic needs of the modern educational landscape. With BIMS as its anchor, TERAS offers a plethora of academic resources, facilitating personalized learning experiences, enhancing collaborative projects, and fostering innovation and creativity among students and educators alike.The integration of data analytics and artificial intelligence within the TERAS ecosystem promises a tailored educational journey for each student. These technological innovations are geared towards not just addressing the learning needs of today but are also scalable to meet the evolving demands of the future.As Nigeria stands on the brink of an educational renaissance, TERAS, with BIMS at its core, is leading the charge. The introduction of this ecosystem is not just a significant leap for the country but serves as a beacon for other nations in the region, exemplifying the transformative power of integrating technology and education.In conclusion, the unveiling of the TERAS ecosystem marks a historic juncture in the journey of Nigerian tertiary education. Every student, educator, and institution stands to gain from the enriched, technologically empowered educational landscape that TERAS promises. It is a manifestation of the country’s steadfast commitment to nurturing a future generation that is not just educated but is also innovative, resourceful, and ready to propel the nation into an era of unprecedented growth and prosperity.\"}]},\n",

       "    'quoted_text': 'The trial of Bishop Feyiropo Daniels, the founder of “I Reign Christian Ministry”, in the Lekki area of Lagos, continued on Friday at the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court sitting in the Ikeja.The Bishop, who took to the witness box in his own defence, testified that he believes three out of the four women who accused him of sexually assaulting them conspired to turn against him.While answering questions under cross-examination, the prosecution’s lead counsel, Babajide Boye, sought to establish that the defendant, Bishop Daniels had a ‘personal relationship’ with the four women.Mr Boye alleged that the defendant had counselled one of the women, given the amount of N100,000 to another for hospital treatment, paid school fees for a third and related with a fourth, as a leader in the campus fellowship affiliated with his ministry at Akungba-Akobo in Ondo State.But the Bishop denied giving money to one of the women for treatment. He said, “I believe all three ladies turned against me, but not (name withheld), because she later apologised to me.”When asked why the accusations from the ladies were all sexual in nature, the defendant said he didn’t know.Mr Boye also accused the defendant of using his position as a Pastor to manipulate persons who come to him for counseling .“You are a man of God. Are you not? A powerful man of God. You get trained to counsel, and you use wisdom and the leading of the spirit to manipulate.”Bishop Daniels denied this allegation. He said, “I am not a powerful man, I am a pastor. I do not use power to counsel people, I am not a manipulator”.The Prosecutor further grilled the defendant, “You visited your Akungba fellowship centre and when she (one of the alleged victims) saw you, she hissed. Were you not surprised as a pastor?“No. She was disgruntled because I couldn’t help her financially.”“Are you her father?”“No”“So she isn’t your responsibility.“yes”The defendant also denied tampering with the WhatsApp messages between him and one of his alleged victims.During the cross examination, the prosecutor also sought to tender four statements purportedly written by the defendant whilst in police custody at various intervals last year.“There are contradictions between the defendant’s testimony and contents of the documents. We seek to use them to impeach his testimony. We rely on section 232 of the Evidence Act, that evidence even though obtained improperly is still admissible and we urge the court to admit same,” Boye said.The defence counsel, Adebayo Adegbite, raised objections to the admissibility of the statements. He argued that the statements were not made by the defendant and that the Bishop signed them under duress.“The statements are a mixture of confession and denial. We leave it to the court to determine whether they amount to a confession. Right from the start of this trial, the defendant has denied the charges, that’s his plea. The documents weren’t made voluntarily. Even if there were contradictions, he wasn’t the maker of the documents, they were written by the police,” Adegbite stated.In his ruling, Justice Rahman Oshodi, admitted the documents. The judge said, “By section 9(3) and (4) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State (2021), the presence of a video testimony of the suspect is desirable but not compulsory. I will admit the documents and later consider the evidential value to place on them. The objection of the defence is hereby overruled.”Justice Oshodi then adjourned the matter to December 20, 2023, for the adoption of final written addresses of the parties.'}]},\n",

He has to face the disciplinary committee,” Amah vowed.He further avowed that Wabara could only be forgiven by the party if he apologised to the disciplinary committee for his alleged unguarded utterances.According to him, the claim by the former Senate President that he was misquoted by the media was not acceptable to the Abia PDP until he appeared before the disciplinary committee to explain himself and offer the necessary apologies.Abia PDP recently issued a statement in which it disowned the former Senate President’s alleged endorsement of Governor Alex Otti for a second term in office.On the Abia State government’s recent directive that the Lokpanta Cattle Market in Umuchieze, Umunnochi LGA, should operate as a daily market, Abraham Amah commended Governor Alex Otti for taking the step.

In the US, about 100% of the working population (18-64) voted in the November 2020 elections. Voting therefore should be seen as a Business function.

The Demographics; The Government in Power; The Cultural Prevalence (right or wrong); The Regional and National Literacies; Technology; and The Entrepreneurial Macro-Structures available.How To Affect The Macro Environment?1. A Businessman must actively look out for, and liberally sponsor qualified candidates of his choice. He must encourage them. He shouldn’t look at this as an expense but as an annual investment to his own income returns and savings.2. He should donate to Political parties that serve his interests. He should actively look for their account details.3. He actively search for and encourage persons whom he thinks fit, for office.4. He should register with a Political party he sees as best business friendly. This will help him stay abreast on issues of his relevance and activity ready.5. He should sponsor charities, causes and non-profit activities around his direct business environment. It does not matter if he is small or medium. He should extend a hand to causes he can list out and annually.6. He should annually spend on educating himself (and family) on technology and other improvements. He could spent little more on travels, readings and on educating another.

His skin clung tightly to his bones, giving him an almost skeletal appearance. The sharp contours of his face, especially around his eyes, made it evident that age had taken a toll, leaving behind just a mere shadow of his once youthful self.Despite his delicate condition, the spirit of celebration was alive. Voices in the background could be heard wishing him a longer life and continued prosperity. The paradox of the situation was evident – while he looked like he had endured several lifetimes, there was still a collective wish for him to experience even more years.The authenticity of his age remains a topic of debate. If the claim were accurate, he would be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, living humans ever recorded.

Extortion is never part of any agencies mandate, either armed or not. We condemn such, and even the IGP has made it clear.“The IGP has warned officers not to drop his name to extort or dupe Nigerians and not to take any gift to him. We made an official statement to this effect. You need to read and comprehend comments before you pass any judgement or make condemnation here.“My comment was clear enough. Must we continue to pay these erring policemen? Are we going to continue this way? In fact, when i read in his tweet that he resisted, i was happy, but he could have resisted till d end. He was with them in the station premises.“He was not on the road. No one supported the extortion, but he shouldn’t have paid them after his initial moves and resistance. I think my assertion is clearer to you now. Thanks.”'}]},\n",

       "    'quoted_text': ' the Economic Community of West African States imposed trade and financial sanctions on Niger after the rebel soldiers toppled Bazoum. Instead of heeding the bloc’s seven-day ultimatum to reinstate Bazoum or face potential military intervention, the soldiers who seized power closed Niger’s airspace.The bloc also sought to send a delegation to Niamey on Tuesday ahead of Thursday’s crisis summit. But the ruling military blocked the mission, saying public “anger” triggered by the bloc’s sanctions meant the delegation’s safety could be at risk.In a statement, ECOWAS confirmed that the visit by a joint delegation with African Union and United Nations officials had been refused. In a further show of defiance and possible intent to hold on to power, the military leaders announced on Monday the appointment of Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine as the new prime minister.\"Difficult\" TalksECOWAS is struggling with a cascade of coups since 2020 that have now hit four of its 15 members. In Mali, Burkina Faso and now Niger, all the takeovers have been fuelled by jihadist insurgencies that have claimed many thousands of lives, forced at least two million from their homes and dealt crippling blows to some of the world’s poorest economies.On Monday, veteran US envoy Victoria Nuland met with Niger’s military rulers for more than two hours but came away empty-handed. She described her talks as “extremely frank and at times quite difficult”.She said she offered the coup leaders “a number of options” to end the crisis and restore relations with the United States, which like other Western nations has suspended aid..“I would not say that we were in any way taken up on that offer,” she told reporters before her departure.Niger’s new head, General Abdourahamane Tiani, did not attend the meeting, and Nuland was unable to see Bazoum, who has been detained since July 26.WarningsThe military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have expressed solidarity with Niger, saying any military intervention would be seen as a “declaration of war” against them.The two countries sent letters Tuesday to the United Nations and the African Union, calling on them to prevent “military intervention against Niger” where the security and humanitarian consequences of such action “would be unpredictable”.Algeria, which shares a long land border with Niger, has also cautioned against a military incursion, which President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said would be “a direct threat” to his country.Bazoum, 63, was feted in 2021 after winning elections that ushered in Niger’s first-ever peaceful transition of power. He took the helm of a country burdened by four previous coups since independence, and survived two attempted putsches before he himself was ousted.His support was a key factor in France’s decision last year to refocus its Sahel anti-jihadist mission on Niger after withdrawing from Mali and Burkina Faso.France has 1,500 troops in Niger and the United States has 1,000 personnel, most of whom are deployed at two major air bases.'}]},\n",
